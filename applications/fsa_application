Craig is currently president of his fraternity, captain of the varsity Waterpolo team, and a member of the national varsity swim team. 

*Gus's Bio
Gus is receiving his BS in physics from MIT this June.  His focus has been on ultra-cold atomic physics, and he has worked in 5 different labs ranging from condensed matter physics to plasma physics.  He sings with the Logarhythms, is a Freshman Leadership Program counselor, is a (half) Iron Man, and cooks a mean pork roulade. 

* How long have you known each other, and what have you worked on in the past? (Include past work done on this project, if applicable.)
We have been working on this project together since January, as part of 6.S078, Entrepreneurship Project. We have been working with another student as well, Turner Bohlen. Unfortunately Turner won't be able to join us for the summer as he has previous commitments.

Troy and Gus have known each other since their freshman year, and have been co-counselors in the Freshman Leadership Program for the past 2 years.

*How should we categorize your project? (Note: The FSA review team may reassign categories if necessary.)
Products and Services

*What problem are you trying to solve through your project?
3D scanning has a wide variety of applications, but the high cost of these scanners keeps the technology from being used in many potential applications. Bringing down the cost and complexity of accurate 3D scanning would enable the use of 3D scanning in many applications where it now is prohibitively expensive: research labs, hobbyist builders, 3D printing enthusiasts, artists, independent product designers, small manufacturers, etc.

We found that there is an academically popular method, structured light scanning, that maintains high scan accuracy, at lower costs. However, there is typically a large degree of complexity in setting up a structured light scanner;  streamlining this service and package it into a plug-and-play device, will enable us to sell the product to markets that currently cannot access or afford 3D scanning. Additionally, we can make the product even less expensive than typical structured light scanners by substituting inexpensive components, such as smart phone cameras, in cleaver ways.  

In short, we want to bring 3D scanning to a large group of users who cannot access it today.  We will do this by building a low-cost, user-friendly, and high-accuracy, 3D scanner.

Proposed Milestones (aka how your team earns up to $20K!)
What do you want to achieve this summer? We will work with you to create rigorous yet achievable milestones, but we'd first like to hear from you. Where do you want your team to be by mid-September regarding customers, product, team, and finances? For more explanation about milestones, including examples, please go to http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/fsa
*Proposed Customer Milestones (list 2-5)
- Decision on whether we can successfully market to both hobbyist consumers and small businesses/labs.
- (Possibly) Launch of Kickstarter campaign to raise excitement and additional funding/gauge interest OR secure a list of beta testers to launch a private beta of the product.

*Proposed Product Milestones (list 2-5)
- Finalize which low-cost projection method will be used in the scanner.
- Complete an alpha prototype of the scanner.
- Create a component list for a beta version of the product
- Develop an IP strategy to protect the design components of the product. Determine whether filing for provisional patents is appropriate (most likely for the projection technique).  If it is, file the patents.

*Proposed Team Milestones (list 2-5)
- Clearly define team members' roles on the team, exploiting strengths and weaknesses. 
- Finalize team members' equity splits and vesting schedules, defining what will happen under different possible scenarios. Specifically, what will happen if a team member wants finish school, working on the startup on a part-time basis, and then returns full-time to the company.
- Identify gaps on the team, develop a plan to fill them, and execute it.  Specifically, plan a path to cope with a team member returning to school at the end of the summer.

*Proposed Financial Milestones (list 2-5)
- Identify projected unit manufacturing cost at various build volumes, using beta prototype component list.
- Develop a high quality short and long pitch deck for financial presentations. 
- Apply to VCs, angels, or further accelerators as appropriate to secure funding for after the summer.

*What inspired your team to get together and work on this project?
Our team has a strong desire to create a product in the hardware/robotics space that has a high impact, and aligns with our skill sets. After much brainstorming, 3D scanning stood out as field that is interesting to all of us, appropriately complex, and needs improvement. We saw all of the excitement surrounding 3D printing, and thought that there should be similar excitement around 3D scanning, but that it wasn't there. We looked into 3D scanning more, and found that it has many exciting uses, but prohibitively high cost and complexity keep its use restricted to large enterprises.  We realized that we could create an accurate, easy-to-use, low-cost solution, that would put this technology into the hands of vastly more people than can currently access it.

*Who do you view as your competitors, and how do you differ from them?
Our competitors can be separated into 3 categories

The current lowest-cost high-accuracy options:
The major competitors in this range would be the NextEngine scanner or Artec's 3D scanners.  Our price will be significantly lower than these products, and our scanner will be easier to use than the NextEnginer scanner. The NextEngine costs over $3,000 (once you've purchased all the necessary software), and the least expensive Artec scanner costs $12,000. Our scanner's accuracy will be in the same range as these products.  Unlike these products, however, our scanner will only be able to scan objects that are under a certain size. While the Artec scanners make scaning of large objects fairly simple, the scanning large objects with the NextEngine is very inconvenient. That is similarly true for other products in that range. 

The very low-cost (free) options:
There are some options on the market that come in at a price lower than our.  AutoDesk as an free app called 123D Catch--you take a series of images of an object and then it performs image reconstruction to generate a 3D model. Some products (like Scanect) allow a customer to use a Kinect to perform 3D scanning, and Microsoft recently released KinectFusion, which turns the Kinect into a 3D scanner for anyone with the Windows Kinect SDK. These technologies, though, do not provide the level of accuracy we are seeking.  They have more difficulty with highly specular objects than we will, and require user participation during the entire scanning process.

The emerging competitors:
There are a couple competitors that have announced products but don't have anything for sale yet.  CADScan successfully completed a Kickstarter project for a desktop 3D scanner that will be similar to ours in terms of target specifications and customers.  From the Kickstarter funding levels, it seems that they plan on charging at least £600 for the scanner, a price we are planning to come in significantly below.  MakerBot also just announced at SXSW that they will be producing a desktop 3D scanner called the Digitizer. It was very nebulous on details, but given their 3D printer costs and their description of the Digitizer, we surmise that they will be charging over $1500.

*Who is your target customer? (Hint: "Everyone" is not the right answer.)
We are targeting individual consumers and small businesses.

The individual consumers we are targeting are hobbyists, enthusiasts, and artists. Many people have gotten really excited about desktop 3D printing, and will be similarly excited by desktop 3D scanning.  There is evidence for this by CADScan's successful Kickstarter campaign, and the excitment surrounding MakerBot's SXSW Digitizer announcement. Though much of the popular focus has been on scanning objects in order to get a model to print, other uses of 3D scanners can be marketed. Maybe a young child wants to send his grandmother something he made, but she lives on the other side of the country; he could scan in his creation then send it to his grandmother, allowing her to enjoy it immediately.
// This example seems rather contrived... what grandma uses CAD?

The small businesses we are focusing on include research labs, product designers, and small manufacturers. In research labs, it is often important to have models and measurements of objects being tested; while the 3D scanners available today would be an unaffordable luxury, ours would be low-cost enough to have a practical purpose.  Product designers can make initial designs with physical materials, which are nicer to work with, and then scan them to get a usable CAD model. Small manufacturers and machine shops can use them in the same fashion that large manufacturers do: for automated verification of manufactured parts.

*Have you received any funding (including angels, family/friends, personal dollars invested, etc.)? Do you have any customers? (These two questions help us gauge your starting point, so don't worry, there is no "wrong answer.")
We have not received any funding so far. There has been a small amount of personal money spent for materials, but nothing very significant.

*We will have a lot of applications for this program, so choosing our final teams will be tough. Why do you think you should rise to the top? What sets you apart from other teams?
The aptitude of our team sets us apart. The team was chosen in order to assemble the skills necessary to successfully execute on a hardware startup, and it shows.  We have three dedicated, brilliant, and hard-working team members, each with their own unique technical skill set: programming and robotic systems, mechanical engineering and embedded systems, and optics and signal processing. We hustle to get customer desires from the source, and having the product vision needed to build a product that users want.

We have been working on this project over the semester as part of 6.S078, Entrepeneurship Project, and are excited to take it to the next level.
