\section{Executive Summary}
3D scanning has a wide variety of applications, from tolerance checking in
machine shops, to measurement and modeling in art studios, but the high cost of
current scanners keeps the technology from being used in many of these potential
applications. Bringing down the cost and complexity of accurate 3D scanning
opens it up to use by researchers, garage hobbyists, 3D printing enthusiasts,
artists, independent product designers, small manufacturers, etc. 3D scanners
have the potential to become the world's standard measurement and modeling tool, with a
place in every shop, studio, and lab. Our team of 4 MIT undergrads, trained
as as physicists, roboticists, programmers, mechanical engineers, and
entrepreneurs, has the skills and vision necessary to build the 3D scanner that
will make this vision a reality. Using the academically popular
method of structured light 3D scanning, we can combine low-cost hardware
components with state of the art software to create a low-cost and user-friendly
3D scanner that has the accuracy of systems an order of magnitude more
expensive. With options at the high end, mobile, and entry level markets,
full-field structured light 3D scanning is entering a phase of rapid market
adoption.

\section{Market Overview}
\subsection{Market Setting}
Digital 3D scanning is a large, established market, with an estimated market
size of \$530 million\cite{frost}, projected to double in size by 2015\cite{arc}.  Most of the products in this market are high-end
and targeted at large corporations, costing tens of thousands of dollars.
Reductions in component costs, advances in algorithmic efficiency, and increases
in computing power now enable inexpensive 3D scanners that can achieve
accuracy levels that are comparable to the expensive units.

Through building an accessible, affordable, desktop 3D scanner, we hope to
expose a new, untapped market. The desktop 3D printing market has been
experiencing rapid growth over the past few years, growing 240\% each year from
2006 to 2011\cite{wohlers}. The primary customers for desktop 3D printers have been
individuals: hobbyists, independent designers, artists, etc. We believe that
this same market segment will buy an inexpensive desktop 3D scanner. In fact, we
believe that 3D scanners will be the standard measurement tool used in shops,
labs and studios. We believe that 3D scanners should be as common as a purchase
as a cordless drill.

The 3D scanner needed by market has a set of requirements that we believe no
other scanner on the market currently meets:
\begin{itemize}
\item It must be painless to use.  From opening the box, the user needs to be
  able to plug the scanner into his computer, put an object in the scanner,
  press scan, and then have a 3D model appear on his computer.
\item It must be affordable.  The scanner cannot cost so much that it is a
  luxury to the user.  We judge that the scanner must be in the \$300-\$600
  price range.
\item It must be useful.  The scanner needs to have an accuracy high enough to
  not be a constraint on most machining processes or 3D printing processes.  It
  cannot take too long to scan. It must be able to scan all objects that can be
  3D printed, and a significant percentage of objects that would be used in a design.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customers}
The market segment we are targeting be divided into individual consumers and small
($< 10$ people) enterprises.

The individual consumers we are targeting are hobbyists, enthusiasts, and
artists. Many people have become excited about desktop 3D printing, and will be
similarly excited by desktop 3D scanning. There is evidence for this in recent
successful crowd-sourced fundings for desktop 3D scanning projects, and
excitement surrounding 3D scanning announcements. Though much of the popular
focus has been on scanning objects in order to get a model to print, other uses
of 3D scanners can be marketed. A sculptor may want to display his work online,
or send an early version of a sculpture to a colleague; our scanner allows him
to do so with ease. A garage tinkerer may need to get the dimensions of an
object he wants to incorporate into a larger project. 

The small enterprises we are focusing on include research labs, product
designers, and small machine shops. In research labs, it is often important to
have models and measurements of objects being tested; while the 3D scanners
available today would be an unaffordable luxury, ours would be low-cost enough
to have a practical purpose. Product designers can make initial designs with
physical materials, which are nicer to work with, and then scan them to get a
usable CAD model. Small manufacturers and machine shops can use them in the same
fashion that large manufacturers do: for automated verification of manufactured
parts, as well as for designing parts with unknown dimensions.

\subsection{Competitors}
As 3D scanning technology has existed for a good deal of time, there are a
number of 3D scanning products that exist. We believe that none of these address
the needs of the market we are trying to target. A few other companies
apparently have these same belief, and so there are a few competitors emerging
that are entering in our target market.

We will explore the major competitors we believe we face by dividing them into 3
categories: the least-expensive high-accuracy scanners, free
scanners, and emerging competitors.  While companies in the first two
categories aren't direct competitors, their products could be attractive to
customers at the edges of our target market segment.

\subsubsection{Least-expensive high-accuracy scanners}
These competitors are the companies offering the least expensive 3D scanners
that offer around 0.1 mm accuracy or better. The major companies in this range
are the NextEngine scanner or Artec's 3D scanners. Our price (~\$500) will be
significantly lower than these products, and our scanner will be easier to use
than the NextEnginer scanner. The NextEngine costs over
\$3,000\cite{nextengine}, and the least expensive Artec scanner costs
\$12,000\cite{artec}. Our scanner's accuracy will be in the same range as these
products. Unlike these products, however, our scanner will only be able to scan
objects that are under a certain size (1 $ft^3$). While the Artec scanners make
scanning large objects fairly simple, scanning large objects with the NextEngine
is very inconvenient, which is also true for other products in the their price
range. Our scanner is clearly targeting a different customer than the Artec
scanner, as \$12,000 is more than our target customer is willing to pay.  We
differentiate from the NextEngine primarily in cost, but also in having more
user-friendly, beautiful software.  The NextEngine software can only run on
Windows, and does not have the polish of a modern software solution. 

\subsubsection{Free scanners}
These are scanning systems that are either free to use, or very cheap. They will
be at a price lower than what we are planning. AutoDesk as an free app called
123D Catch--you take a series of images of an object and then it performs image
reconstruction to generate a 3D model\cite{123d}. Some products (like Scanect)
allow a customer to use a Kinect to perform 3D scanning, and Microsoft recently
released KinectFusion, which turns the Kinect into a 3D scanner for anyone with
the Windows Kinect SDK\cite{kinectfusion}. Although the accuracy of the scans
made with these scans are not published, it is clear from looking at the
showcase scans that they are not capturing sub-millimeter accuracy. That would
make these scans limiting in when used with a 3D printer or for machining. They
additionally more difficulty with highly specular objects than we will, and
require user participation during the entire scanning process.

\subsubsection{Developing Scanners}
There are a couple competitors that have announced products but do not have
products on shelves yet who seem to be targeting the same market segment that we
are. CADScan successfully completed a Kickstarter project for a desktop 3D
scanner that will be similar to ours in terms of target specifications and
customers\cite{cadscan}. From the Kickstarter funding levels, it seems that they
plan on charging at least $\pounds$650 (\$1000) for the scanner, a price we are
planning on significantly undercutting. MakerBot also just announced at SXSW
that they will be producing a desktop 3D scanner called the
Digitizer\cite{digitizer}. The announcement was very nebulous on details, but
given their 3D printer costs and their description of the Digitizer, we surmise
that they will be charging around \$1000. The Matterform Photon 3D scanner also
had a successful crowd-funding campaing, raising \$471,082 on
indiegogo\cite{photon}. The Photon is certainly targeting the same market as us,
but our scanner is differentiated from theirs by allowing a much larger maximum
scannable volume: 1 $ft^3$ as opposed to $0.25 ft^3$. Their technology choice,
striping with a single laser beam, will not allow them to increase the scannable
volume without proportionally increasing the scan time. We do yet not know how
our product can be differentiated from the CADScan and the Digitizer as they
have not yet announced product specifics.

\section{Innovation and Approach}
Our product goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intuitive, clean software interface, accessible to users with limited to no CAD background
\item .025mm accuracy - sub-machine tolerance
\item 5 minute or less scan time
\item 1 ft$^3$ scan volume
\item \$500 price point
\item Plug and play software
\end{itemize}

 To achieve these goals, we will use a technique called structured light scanning. The structured light scanning process consists of projecting a known image onto the object being scanned.  This known image, usually stripes or a grid, will deform and using this deformed image, the object's surface can be reconstructed using triangulation. \cite{StructuredLight}   This method does not require complex components; all that is necessary is an imaging system, such as digital cameras, and a projection system. Instead of using a traditional, expensive DLP projector, we are using a grating system to minimize costs. 

There are tutorials online for how consumers can set up their own structured light scanners using a standard projector and a digital camera\cite{DIYScanning}, but the amount of time required to calibrate the scanner and the hardware required makes the do-it-yourself approach both prohibitively difficult and expensive. 

What we require for our product (a pre-calibrated, affordable, high-resolution 3D scanner) is a  projection system,  an imaging system, and  the software to process the acquired data and generate a point cloud. The following discusses our development of the three subsystems so far.

\textbf{ Projection}: 

In order to get around the requirement of having a standard projector (for which the cheapest units retail for \$300 in the US, \$75 from China) we instead looked into the cheapest way that we could project a static, high-contrast image on our object. We looked into doing this using the interference properties of coherent laser light but instead opted for projecting a high contrast silhouette of a grating onto the object. Using simple geometric arguments, the factor limiting the contrast of the projected silhouette is the size of the light source (as one can imagine, the projected image is simply the image created by a point light source convolved over the size of the light source). Our approach: to focus a well-collimated light source down to a single point л- effectively creating a point light source лл and then allowing it to propagate through the focal point and diverge to cover an area large enough to cover our whole object. All that this requires is a single lens and a collimated light source, for which we used a laser and a 15mm focal length lens from Thorlabs, but from initial testing we believe we can improve on the existing setup substantially while still keeping costs low. Employing a well-collimated, incoherent, white light source and a system of lenses should allow us to get rid of unwanted interference patterns and project a large enough image from less than 2 feet away.

\textbf{ Imaging}:

The Smartphone industry has helped create a large demand for small, high resolution, inexpensive imaging sensor. These imaging sensors are the bare bones of digital cameras for only a fraction of the cost.  The sensors are available for less than \$10, even in small quantities, and can produce images in the 5-12 megapixel range\cite{sensorData}. The imaging sensors allow us to maintain affordability while still provide high accuracy. Microcontrollers are also at a point where they are cheap, but easily powerful enough to utilize the full potential of the sensor. Craig is currently doing development using a Cypress PSoC (Programmable System on Chip), which allows for fast prototyping, without the need for peripheral chips, as they can be programmed into the PSoC. This minimizes downtime wiring chips or designing Printed Circuit Boards, and reduces cost. 

\textbf{ Software}:

The initial software system is being built on top of two widely used open source
libraries, OpenCV and Point Cloud Library. Both libraries are free for
commercial use under the BSD license.  The libraries allow us to leverage the
significant infrastructure built for robotic applications.  This is particularly
valuable in using various algorithms for point cloud meshing. Error-mitigation
during the meshing process is complex algorithmically, and building on top of
existing software will make the process much easier.

The real value in the software is in making the system easy to use and
accessible. The system needs to entirely pre-calibrated, and able to
automatically re-calibrate over time.  The user needs to be able to plug the
scanner in and have it work.  The software needs to be minimalistic and
intuitive. A significant proportion of our target market won't have used CAD
before, so it needs to interface with a bundled accesible model-viewing program.
Of course it will support export of files to other CAD programs.

Although all of those features seem to be obvious candidates for inclusion,
existing 3D scanning products do not have what qualifies as beautiful, modern
software. Our team members' experience with web development and UI design will help us
build dead simple software that will differentiate our scanner from the
competition.

\section{Lessons Learned}

\textbf{Imaging}:
Many of the issues that arose from prototyping have to do with the physical layout of the circuits. Many of the advanced sensors come in a format that is difficult to work with. The chips come in a Ball Grid Array package, which is not easily dealt with by prototyping. The grid consists of 56 balls of solder each spaced about 500-600$\mu$m apart, which are impossible to solder to directly; they must be reflowed onto a PCB. While this should not be a problem when dealing with the end product, it means that developmental tools are invaluable during initial phases. 

\textbf{Market study}:
When we first started exploring the 3D scanning space, NextEngine was the only company that had a viable product for consumers. However, we feel that the expense and difficulty associated with their product. There has been a significant debate over how large the consumer level 3D scanning market is. Experts in the industry are skeptical that there is demand outside of commercial settings, however the success of several recent crowdfunded projects, such as the Photon and CADScan, help to counteract their concerns.
